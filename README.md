# VOXT - Talk & Type on Linux 🗣️⌨️

A fast voice-to-text helper for **any** Linux app, using **LOCAL** voice processing.  
Hit a **global shortcut**, speak, and watch your words appear wherever the cursor lives.  
Optionally, have your transcript **AI-rewritten** by **LOCAL** (Ollama) or remote AI model before output.

## 📦 Installation

**Works on modern Linux** – Ubuntu 24.04, Fedora 40, Pop!\_OS 22, etc.  
After this you will have a global `voxt` command available in any shell.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jacob8472/voxt.git
cd voxt && ./setup.sh    # builds deps *and* installs a global `voxt` command
```

The setup script now offers to install **pipx** automatically (default *Yes*)
and registers the `voxt` command on your `$PATH`.  Developers can still run

```bash
pipx install --editable .
```

after cloning if they prefer an editable install.

## 🏃 Usage — Setting up a **global Record/Stop shortcut**

1. **Open your system keyboard-shortcuts panel**
   *GNOME:* Settings → Keyboard → "Custom Shortcuts"
   *KDE / XFCE / Cinnamon:* similar path.

2. **Add a new shortcut:**

| Field        | Value *(copy the command exactly)*               |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Name**     | VOXT • Record                     |
| **Command**  | `bash -c 'voxt --trigger-record'` |
| **Shortcut** | e.g. `Super + r`              |

3. Click **Add / Save**.
4. Launch VOXT in any mode (CLI, GUI, or tray). From now on:

| Press hotkey …   | VOXT does …                                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **First press**  | start recording                                             |
| **Second press** | stop ⇢ transcribe ⇢ copy to clipboard ⇢ (typing if enabled) |

### Quick-start examples

```bash
voxt --gui      # friendly pill-button window
voxt --tray    # sits in the tray; perfect for continuous dictation
voxt --cli      # terminal REPL; 'h' shows commands
```

**Add app-menu launchers later**
```bash
./launcher_setup.sh        # pick GUI, Tray, or both
./launcher_setup.sh --edit # fix existing launchers (if they freeze on "Typing...")
```

*(The very first run may download/build its own `whisper-cli` into the app's root — symlinks it to `~/.local/bin/` — subsequent starts are instant.)*


### 🎙️  Managing speech models

VOXT needs a Whisper GGML model file.  
Use the built-in model-manager to fetch the default (≈142 MB):

```bash
voxt-model install base.en     # or tiny.en / small / medium … see list below
```
That downloads into ~/.local/share/voxt/models/ and VOXT will
automatically pick it up.

Common commands:
```bash
voxt-model list	# show models already on disk
voxt-model install tiny.en  #	download another model ("fetch" can be also used as alias for "install")
voxt-model --no-check install base.en # download a model and skip SHA-1 verification (rarely needed)
voxt-model remove tiny.en	# delete a model
voxt-model use tiny.en	# make that model the default (edits config.yaml)
```

Some of the available keys (size MB):

tiny.en 75 · tiny 142 · base.en 142 · base 142 ·
small.en 466 · small 466 · medium.en 1500 · medium 1500 · large-v3 2900

## ⚙️ Config (first-run auto-generated)

Available to edit in GUI and TRAY modes, as well as for power-users here:
`~/.config/voxt/config.yaml`
Unknown keys are ignored.

## 🧠 AI Post-Processing (AIPP)
Your spoken words can be magically cleaned and rendered into e.g. neatly formated email, or straight away into a programing code!  

VOXT can optionally post-process your transcripts using LOCAL (on-machine, **Ollama**) or cloud LLMs (like **OpenAI, Anthropic, or xAI**).  
For the local processing, first **[install Ollama](https://ollama.ai)** and download a model that can be run on your machine, e.g. `ollama pull gemma3:latest`.   
You can enable, configure, and manage prompts directly from the GUI.

### Enable AIPP:
In CLI mode, use `--aipp` argument.  
In GUI or TRAY mode, all relevant settings are in: "*AI Post-Processing*".  
**Seleting provider & model** - models are tied to their respective providers!  
**Editing Prompts** - Select "*Manage prompts*" or "*Prompts*" to edit up to 4 of them.

## Supported providers:

- Ollama (local)  
- OpenAI  
- Anthropic  
- xAI  

---

### 🔑 Setting API Keys for the remote API providers

For security, VOXT does **not** store API keys in config files.  
To use cloud AIPP providers, set the required API key(s) in your shell environment before running VOXT:

```sh
# For OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# For Anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="..."

# For xAI
export XAI_API_KEY="..."
```

You can add these lines to your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or equivalent shell profile for convenience.

**Note:**  
If an API key is missing, cloud-based AIPP providers will not work and you will see an error.

## 🩺 Troubleshooting cheatsheet

| Symptom                            | Likely cause / fix                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Press hotkey, nothing happens*    | Troubleshoot with this command: `gnome-terminal -- bash -c "voxt --trigger-record; read -p 'Press Enter...'"` |
| *Transcript printed but not typed* | Wayland: `ydotool` not installed or user not in `input` group → run `setup_ydotool.sh`, relog.                 |
| *"whisper-cli not found"*          | Build failed - rerun `./setup.sh` and check any diagnostic output.                                                      |
| *Mic not recording*                | Verify in system settings: **input device available**? / **active**? / **not muted**?                                        |
| Clipboard empty                    | ensure `xclip` or `wl-copy`  present (re-run `setup.sh`).                                |

## 🗑️  Removal / Uninstall

### 1. Repo-clone install (`./setup.sh`)
If you cloned this repository and ran `./setup.sh` inside it:

```bash
# From inside the repo folder
# (1) leave the venv if it is currently active
deactivate 2>/dev/null || true

# (2) delete everything that the helper script created in-place
rm -rf .venv              # Python virtual-env
rm -rf whisper.cpp        # whisper.cpp sources + binaries
rm -f  ~/.local/bin/whisper-cli   # symlink created by setup.sh

# (3) finally remove the repo folder itself
cd .. && rm -rf voxt
```

### 2. pipx install
If voxt was installed through **pipx** (either directly or via the prompt at the end of `setup.sh`):

```bash
pipx uninstall voxt
```

### 3. Optional runtime clean-up
These steps remove user-level state that VOXT (or its Wayland helper) may have created. They are **safe to skip** – do them only if you want a fully pristine system.

```bash
# Stop any live processes
pkill -f voxt      || true
pkill -f ydotoold   || true

# Systemd user service (only if you previously ran setup_ydotool.sh)
systemctl --user stop    ydotoold.service   2>/dev/null || true
systemctl --user disable ydotoold.service   2>/dev/null || true
rm -f ~/.config/systemd/user/ydotoold.service

# XDG config & cache
rm -rf ~/.config/voxt      # settings file, absolute paths, etc.

# Desktop launcher
rm -f ~/.local/share/applications/voxt.desktop
rm -f ~/.local/share/applications/voxt-*.desktop

# Udev rule (Wayland only ‑ created for ydotool)
sudo rm -f /etc/udev/rules.d/99-uinput.rules 2>/dev/null || true

# Optionally remove yourself from the 'input' group again
# (Only necessary if you added it just for ydotool)
sudo gpasswd -d "$USER" input 2>/dev/null || true
```

### 4. System packages
`setup.sh` installs broadly useful distro packages (ffmpeg, gcc, cmake, portaudio, …). Most users keep them. If you **really** want to roll back, remove them with your package manager, e.g.

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu example
sudo apt remove ffmpeg portaudio19-dev cmake
```

That's it – VOXT is now completely removed from your system.
